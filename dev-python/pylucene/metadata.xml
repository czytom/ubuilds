  PyLucene is a Python extension for accessing Java Lucene. Its goal is to
  allow you to use Lucene's text indexing and searching capabilities from
  Python. PyLucene is not a Lucene port but a Python wrapper around Java
  Lucene. PyLucene embeds a Java VM with Lucene into a Python process. The
  PyLucene Python extension, a Python module called lucene, is
  machine-generated by JCC. PyLucene is built with JCC, a C++ code generator
  that makes it possible to call into Java classes from Python via Java's
  Native Invocation Interface (JNI).
