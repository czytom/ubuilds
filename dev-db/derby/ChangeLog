  apache-derby-10.2.2.0.ebuild, +files/build.patch,
  +files/jdbc2-abstract.patch, +files/jdbc2-pull.patch, +files/vti.patch:
  Make the thing somewhat compile, at least with Sun JDK's 1.4 or 1.5, by
  making all jdbc2 stuff abstract via patch. Need to check/fix with other
  JDK's and try some src_test because god knows if this works.
