	HtmlUnit is a java unit testing framework for testing web based 
	applications. It is similar in concept to httpunit  but is very 
	different in implementation. HttpUnit models the http protocol so 
	you deal with request and response objects. HtmlUnit on the other hand, 
	models the returned document so that you deal with pages and forms and 
	tables.
