  +files/glazedlists-1.7.0-build.xml.patch, +metadata.xml,
  +glazedlists-1.7.0.ebuild:
  Initial commit of glazedlists-1.7.0 to java-experimental overlay. So far, it
  supports the extensions jfreechart, jgoodiesforms, nachocalendar and swingx
  (their deps might need some updates so they are available on all platforms).
  The ebuild supports the Java1.4 and Java5 version of glazedlists, Java1.4
  residing in an extra glazedlists-comapt ebuild directory.
