JDiff is a Javadoc doclet which generates an HTML report of all the packages, classes, constructors, methods, 
and fields which have been removed, added or changed in any way, including their documentation, when two APIs 
are compared. This is very useful for describing exactly what has changed between two releases of a product.

Only the API (Application Programming Interface) of each version is compared. It does not compare what the 
source code does when executed.
