  +metadata.xml, +filters-2.1.2.ebuild:
  Changed SRC_URI to versioned files from dev.java.net, which is also the
  reason for the huge version jump (see bug #198153 and filters-1.0.ebuild in
  java-overlay). Since those archives don't contain a build.xml, target files
  are now created by hand (ejavac, javadoc, etcetera).
