CUP is a system for generating LALR parsers from simple specifications.

It serves the same role as the widely used program YACC [1] and in fact offers most of the features of YACC.
However, CUP is written in Java, uses specifications including embedded Java code, and produces parsers 
which are implemented in Java.
