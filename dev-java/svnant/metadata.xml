SvnAnt is an ant task that provides an interface to Subversion revision control system that is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community.

With the help of the underlying svnClientAdapter, svn task uses javahl - a native (JNI) java interface for the subversion api if it can find the corresponding library.
(See the subclipse FAQ for hints how to get it for your operating system).
Otherwise it uses the svn(.exe) command line interface (which must be present on your OS' path).

SvnAnt supports most of the major Subversion commands.
