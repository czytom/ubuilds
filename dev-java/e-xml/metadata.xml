This library is a collection of tools for parsing XML.  For better or worse,
DOM and SAX are fairly heavy-weight and cumbersome parsing tools, which have
lead others to create libraries such as JDOM and KXML (Enhydra).  For most
of you, the Xerces library will be just fine, and I suggest you stick with
that if performance is not a big problem.
