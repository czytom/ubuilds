  +xmlunit-1.1_beta2.ebuild:
  Version bump. JUnit tests do not pass just for ibm-jdk-bin-1.4 kaffe
  openjdk-1.7. For now left in the same slot as xmlunit-1.0 though these are
  just 70% compatible, but only netbeans depends on it so what just needs to
  be done is test netbeans whether it can build against this new version and
  then either left this bump in the same slot or move it to slot 1.1.
