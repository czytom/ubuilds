		As of 2007-11-03, the Slide project is retired. This site is kept
		online for archiving purposes.

		Due to the lack of a developer community, the codebase was no longer
		actively maintained and security issues could not be addressed by
		bugfix releases. The Jakarta PMC therefore had no other choice but to
		retire Slide. 

		Slide is a content repository which can serve as a basis for a content management system / framework and other purposes. It features:

    	* A fully featured WebDAV client library and command line client
