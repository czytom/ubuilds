		JGraphT is a free Java graph library that provides mathematical graph-theory objects and algorithms. JGraphT supports various types of graphs including:

    * directed and undirected graphs.
    * graphs with weighted / unweighted / labeled or any user-defined edges.
    * various edge multiplicity options, including: simple-graphs, multigraphs, pseudographs.
    * unmodifiable graphs - allow modules to provide "read-only" access to internal graphs.
    * listenable graphs - allow external listeners to track modification events.
    * subgraphs graphs that are auto-updating subgraph views on other graphs.
    * all compositions of above graphs.
