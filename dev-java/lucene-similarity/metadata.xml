		Similarity addon for lucene:
		Note that: the lucene-similarity package is really just a placeholder,
		and does not have any functionality. <pkg>dev-java/lucene-queries</pkg>
		has some document similarity query generators, and is the recommended
		alternative. - We leave this package here for your information.
